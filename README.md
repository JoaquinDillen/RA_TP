This Practical Work was made for the MsC of Electronics Enginheering in Polytechnic Institute of Cávado and Ave for the Advanced Automation & Integrated Labs II subjects

April 2022 Barcelos, Portugal

Advanced Robotics (João Vilaça - jvilaca@ipca.pt)

Specific Objectives:

  Development of a Robotics application using industrial Kuka robotics arm, for the project the goal defined is to create an aplication that enables the robot to perform music in a guitar, the objective is to be finger style. 
  
  The solution goes througout the development of the tool for the solution and then implementation which engloves a user interface, and the algorithm to control the 
robot, the idea is to develop a system who reads tablatures and can reproduce the music.
